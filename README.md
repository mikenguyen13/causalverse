The primary aim of causalverse is to streamline the research process, particularly data analysis, for researchers working in causal inference. It offers a range of helper functions designed to minimize time spent on data analysis. The package includes methods such as regression discontinuity, difference-in-differences, synthetic control, instrumental variables, event studies, and more. Additional methods may be introduced in future updates.
